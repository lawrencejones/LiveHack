LiveHack
========
LiveHack aims to simplify the hackathon process, and add excitement to the
event! We aim to implement a system to allow matching up of project ideas to
the developers that have the skills to see it through, preventing the awkward
time wasting (for those who don't come with team/idea) circles that most 
hackathons host.

Features

otherwise change the current build.
